Uber Ride Request Data Analysis
 Project Title:
Uber Ride Request Data Analysis

 Project Description:
This project involves the analysis of Uber ride request data to identify key trends and operational inefficiencies such as driver unavailability and trip cancellations. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, we explore request patterns over time, uncover peak demand hours, and evaluate the reasons for failed trips.

 Objective:
Analyze ride request patterns by time of day and pickup point.

Identify periods of high cancellations and no car availability.

Suggest actionable insights to improve Uber‚Äôs operations and reduce failed requests.

 Dataset:
The dataset contains Uber ride request data with the following key columns:

Request id

Pickup point (Airport or City)

Driver id

Status (Trip Completed, Cancelled, No Cars Available)

Request timestamp

Drop timestamp

Data Preprocessing:
Converted timestamp columns to datetime format.

Extracted new features like Request Hour, Request Day, and Time Slot.

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.

Standardized column formats for analysis.

üìà Exploratory Data Analysis:
Distribution of ride requests by hour of day, pickup point, and status.

Heatmap of requests by hour and pickup location.

Cancellations and unavailability trends across different time slots.

Identified supply-demand gap in peak hours.

 Key Insights:
Morning Peak (5 AM - 10 AM) from City to Airport had the highest cancellation rate.

Evening Peak (5 PM - 10 PM) from Airport to City saw the most ‚ÄúNo Cars Available‚Äù cases.

Mismatch in demand and driver availability causes operational inefficiency.

Potential improvement areas in driver allocation and incentive models.

 Actions & Recommendations:
Increase driver availability during peak hours using predictive demand models.

Implement a priority system for frequent riders to reduce cancellation impact.

Use driver incentives during high-demand periods to reduce supply gap.

 Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook for development and presentation.

 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can be used to address operational inefficiencies in ride-hailing services. By identifying and visualizing key problem areas, we can help Uber improve customer experience and optimize driver allocation.
